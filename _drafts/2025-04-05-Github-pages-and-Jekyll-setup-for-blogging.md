# Let's start with: Why Github pages and Jekyll work togheter"

This is a fair question. It was the first question I make to myself because I didn't know anything about Jekyll but I was familiarized with github pages. 



# Set your enviroment is crucial. 

Let's break the environment down into pieces. The components needed to use both are:

Ruby 2.7.8
Bundler 2.3.6
Some ruby environment manager like rbenv
Jekyll 3.9.3

Make sure all this dependecies are well installed in your system or your dockerfile if you are using docker.
