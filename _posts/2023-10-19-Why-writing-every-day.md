# Why start writing every day?

The practice of writing every day make a positive difference in how we think and express ourselves. 
Writing is associate with a better capacity of organize a set of complex, abstract and disordered ideas. 
They can be inner thoughts of external uncompleted information that need to be processed. 

The daily practice of writing has a positive effect on how we think and express ourselves. Writing is
 associated with a better ability to organize a series of complex, abstract, and disorganized ideas. 
 These may be internal thougths or external information that needs to be processed. 

Writing is a form of self-expression and allows you to communicate your thoughts and ideas in clear and 
meaningful way. Ultimately, if you are to craft your words precisely not only thinking in what you want to 
express but to change how your readers (if you have them) think you will be able to create original value with your writing. 

Never underestimate the power of words. The ability to communicate high quality ideas is an incredible valuable asset. 

Some other benefits of writing include:

- It can help to improve cognitive skills, memory and creativity
- It is easy to track your progress, you can read what you write
- It can help you better understand and process your emotions and thoughts.
- It can be a therapeutic tool for dealing with stress and anxiety.
- It can help you achieve your goals and improve your productivity.
- It can be a great way to document your personal or professional growth.

Be prepare to get involved in a writing session comes along with some physical and mental resistance that you need to overcome. Among them we can mention distraction of all kinds, the need of move around your chair or clean up your desk, probably you will find beneficial to get more “confortable” or  go grub a cup of coffee, so far so on. Therefore, the practice of have a minimalistic routine that allows you to follow a few steps to setup your body and put down you mind to work is crucial in every kind of system that you create to write consistency. 
I'm talking about creativity to analyze different perspectives, mind control to make your thoughts more clear and make them flow to write fluently, the patience to stay calm when probably you have an stressful environment at work or a few urgent task that need aggressive action but sometimes you prefer to write down some thoughts before engage in those action in order to keep track of the execution of your plan.

Overall, writing is a valuable skill that can help you improve yourself and your life in many ways.
Whether you're writing for personal or professional reasons, it's always worth taking the time to put your thoughts down on paper.

# Why start blogging?

I have an special need to start writing articles to try to put into all the content and information
that I'm interested in so, I was searching for a practical way to do it.

I think that blogging is the perfect fit for me because I want to write articles about topics and put them in public to practice to expose part of myself and have a track record of my interest and thinking process about specifics topics. 

Since always human has tried to put their thoughts in paper in order to be shared and published in order to be share the quality of their ideas, create they own community, try to influence in how other people see the world or other kind of motivation for they willing to go public. 

Internet allow us to spread your word creating content and writing. Probably at some point articles will became a low value asset since they can be produce from scratch using AI. In my opinion only texts with relatively low value for example text that organize information that is quite standard or that has pretty much the same form across the sources. High value literature like books, articles, threads, etc when they value is related to thinking, build a criteria, expose basic principles analysis system or analyze non-existing problems or points of view will retain their value even on a generating AI era. 

Finally I realize that putting my articles in public I need to polish them in order to be understand not only by me but for other readers, this means a different level of quality and exposition not only of your thoughts but of the way you express yourself and even of how you deliver a piece of work or how you order a particular set of complex ideas. 

# Building the habit of writing

When it comes to the how write I just want to open a web page or text file and start writing, it shouldn’t take to much time on fetch the document in order to have a quick manner to download my ideas or the information on it.

I’ve just started focusing in work on a monthly article but continue increasing the frequency of publishing to bi-weekly, to finally one article by week but keeping the monthly article covering more deep analysis, specific problems or complex subjects. 

Other important aspect for me is have the ability of track modification on each file with a
version system like github or other. I like to think the blog as a kind of knowledge data
base and have the order that a code system follow into my articles bring an incredible way
to organize the information in order to build a track record but also have the information
available and connected in some functional way similar to a software documentation.

I decided to use Notion and Github Pages for my online blog. 

# References and bibliography

I take as reference a bunch of blog that I likes to read from time to time from awesome people that have
build and excelent bunch of articles and put a lot of work online available first for themselves but
at the same time for a lot of people out there.

Andrej Karphaty, scientist in chief of Open AI has been an incredible reference for me since I started to follow
his work on 2016 while studying his Standfor Deep Learning Course.
