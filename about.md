Hi! my name's Mauri and I'm a mechatronics engineer and software developer
+4 years of experience working lately with Golang services and Python,
focusing on improving and testing new module implementations. I like to use C/C++ to 
study and solve complex algorithms and currently pursuing a self-taugh education on Web3. 
I also have 2 years of experience working on projects in both the university and
the master's program with Linux and IA tools. 
I have substantial experience in reports and documentation.
I'm passionate about engineering and technology. I'm currently re-building my website 
to bring some visibility to my latest work, projects and research.

I have re-built this blog to refactor the order of the articles and give a more stratightforward
way to put the information. Using a more compact format and the power of markdown. 
The idea is to put in the best order possible some thought, ideas and what I'm learning 
to be available for readers that want to use this articles as tools in the technical side but also
have a bit more of philosophy and some clues about how manage the ambiguity of subjective decisions.
