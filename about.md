Hi! my name's Mauri and I'm a mechatronics engineer and software developer
+4 years of experience working lately with Golang services and Python,
focusing on improving and testing new module implementations. I like to use C/C++ to 
study and solve complex algorithms and currently pursuing a self-taugh education on Web3. 
I also have 2 years of experience working on projects in both the university and
the master's program with Linux and IA tools. 
I have substantial experience in reports and documentation.
I'm passionate about engineering and technology. I'm currently re-building my website 
to bring some visibility to my latest work, projects and research.
