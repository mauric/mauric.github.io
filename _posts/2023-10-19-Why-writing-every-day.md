# Why start writing every day?

The daily practice of writing has a positive effect on how we think and express ourselves. Writing is
 associated with a better ability to organize a series of complex, abstract, and disorganized ideas. 
 These may be internal thougths or external information that needs to be processed. 

Writing is a form of self-expression and allows you to convey your thoughts and ideas in clear and 
meaningful way. If you formulate your words precisely, thinking not only in what you want to 
express, but also about changing the way your readers think (if you have any), you can create original value with your writing. 

Never underestimate the power of words. The ability to communicate high quality ideas is an incredible valuable asset. 

Some other benefits of writing include:

- It can help to improve cognitive skills, memory and creativity
- It is easy to track your progress, you can read what you write
- It can help you better understand and process your emotions and thoughts.
- It can be a therapeutic tool for dealing with stress and anxiety.
- It can help you achieve your goals and improve your productivity.
- It can be a great way to document your personal or professional growth.

The willingness to engage in a writing session comes with some physical and mental resistance that must overcome. These include distraction of all kinds, the need to move around your studio or clean up your desk, perhaps you find it beneficial to get “confortable” or have a cup of coffee, and so on and so forth. Therefore, is important to have a minimalistic routine that allows you to follow a few steps to setup your body and put down your mind to work and build the habit of writring consistenly. 
I'm talking about use creativity to analyze different perspectives, mind control to make your thoughts more clear and make them flow to write fluently and patience to stay calm when probably you have an stressful environment at work or a few urgent task that could pospone your writing. But think about it, sometimes even in this rushing scenarios is better to write down some thoughts before engage in those action in order to keep track of the execution of your plan.

Overall, writing is a valuable skill that can help you improve yourself and your life in many ways.
Whether you're writing for personal or professional reasons, it's always worth taking the time to put your thoughts down on paper.

# Why start blogging?

I have an special need to start writing articles to make more available or organize the content and information
that I read and learn and I was looking for a practical way to do it.

I think that blogging is the perfect fit for me because I want to write articles about isolated topics and publish them. I found interesting to engage this activity and expose part of myself and have a track record of my interest and thinking process about specifics topics. 

Internet allow us to spread your word creating content and writing. Probably at some point articles will became a low value asset since they can be produce from scratch using AI. In my opinion, texts with low aggregated value for example those that organize information that has pretty much the same form across the sources. High value literature that is trying to teach how think, build a criteria, analyze real-world problems using fundamental principles, etc, will keep their value added by the authors even on a generative AI era. 

Finally to publish something you must thoroughly dive into the details and the aesthetic of the text. This is a must if you want that yours readers understand what you tryin to communicate also to make it more readable and easy to go through. Is essencial to cover all different article's levels of abstraction giving the highest quality possible. The same is true for how you explain concepts, use expository resources and the way you express yourself.

# Building the habit of writing

Personally I just want to open the web browser or a text editor and start writing, it shouldn’t take to much time on fetch the document and quickly jote down content on it. 

I’ve just started focusing in work on a monthly article willing to continue increasing the frequency of publishing to bi-weekly. Finally, my goal is to publish one article a week but keeping the monthly article and using it to cover more deep analysis, specific problems or complex subjects. 

Other important aspect for me is, to have the ability of track modification on each file with a
version system like git or other. I like to think the blog as a kind of knowledge database and is nice to have the track record of all modifications
and the possibility to continue adding information or improve the text keeping the changes public. 

I decided to use Notion for the drafts and Github Pages for my online blog. 

# References and bibliography

I take as reference a bunch of blog that I often like to read. These are from awesome people that have create excelent articles 
and put a lot of work online. I like to think that they did it first for themselves but at the same time for a lot of people out there.

But I will put here the most important which belong to Andrej Karphaty, scientist in chief of Open AI has been an incredible reference for me since I started to follow
his work on 2016 while studying his Standfor Deep Learning Course and it has been like a mentor to me.
